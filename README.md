# PyBer_Analysis

Analyzing and visualizing ridesharing data with Python.

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use Pyber ride sharing data to understand ride and fare information by the types of cities in that Pyber operates in.

# Results

- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver. 
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per driver.
- Ubran cities make the most in toal fares while rural cities make the lowest. 

# Summary

## Recommendations

- Increase the amount of drivers in rural areas, as their rides may be longer in general, resulting in a potential loss of a ride. 
- Charge more in urban cities.
- Get more drivers for suburban areas to decrease the disparity in the amount of total rides and total drivers.
